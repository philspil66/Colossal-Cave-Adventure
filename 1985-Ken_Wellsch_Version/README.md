# Ken C. Wellsch's Version (1985)

This version of Adventure is taken from a Zerox Sigma-9 (rest her soul!), originally written by Dave Platt of Honeywell under CP-V (in Fort-77). Ken rewrote it into Ratfor many years ago and a couple years later rewrote it again in C. This is the 550 point version of Adventure (for those who only know the 350 point original).

The system components such as restricting the program's use etc. have been left incomplete. He did them back in the old Ratfor version under V7 but each system can be quite different about determining load etc.
